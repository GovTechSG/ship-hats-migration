## Timelines

We have completed evaluating SaaS-based CI/CD tools based on factors such as product offering, migration effort, feature roadmap, and SaaS hosting in Singapore. The procurement process is in progress.  

Support for SHIP-HATS 1.0 will continue for **at least 1 year** from the roll out of SHIP-HATS 2.0 for all users. 

## Pricing
For all planning purposes, you can refer to current [Standard Pricing](https://sgdcs.sgnet.gov.sg/sites/IDA-GoSync/gdspdd-ai/ship/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/Pricing.aspx) (can be accessed by Public Officers on the Intranet). We will announce the details on the new subscription prices by early Q2â€™ FY22. We will help Agencies migrate the current subscription to SHIP-HATS 2.0 subscription model including signing of an updated Service Agreements.

## Staggered Migration

We want our users to have minimal disruptions. Therefore, we are taking a careful approach of doing several pilots in Q1' FY22 to shape the migration strategy. We will then test the same on GovTech Government Digital Services (GDS) customers on SHIP-HATS in Q2' FY22 and further fine tune.  

In Q3' FY22, we will be inviting Agencies to start migration. For more information on how to choose projects for migration, refer to [System for Early Migration](ship-hats-migration-annex#systems-for-early-migration) in the Annex section.
