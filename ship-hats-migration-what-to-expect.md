# SHIP-HATS Migration Overview

We are upgrading to SHIP-HATS 2.0 to a modern and updated CI/CD Platform on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering a more seamless experience for Agencies to implement an end-to-end CI/CD solution.

## Timelines

We have completed evaluating SaaS CI/CD tools based on factors such as product offering, migration effort, feature roadmap, and SaaS hosting in Singapore and procurement process is in progress. We are on track pilot SHIP-HATS 2.0 in this quarter, Q1FY22. The pilots are by invitation only. 

Support for SHIP-HATS 1.0 will continue for **at least 1 year** from the roll out of SHIP-HATS 2.0 for all users. 

## Pricing
For all planning purposes, you can refer to [Standard Pricing](https://sgdcs.sgnet.gov.sg/sites/IDA-GoSync/gdspdd-ai/ship/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/Pricing.aspx). We will announce the details on the new subscription prices before Q2â€™ FY22. We will help Agencies migrate the current subscription to SHIP-HATS 2.0 subscription model including signing the updated Service Agreements. 

## Staggered Migration

We want our users to have minimal disruptions. Therefore, we are taking a careful approach of doing several pilots in Q1' FY22 to shape the migration strategy. We will then test the same on GovTech Government Digital Services (GDS) customers on SHIP-HATS in Q2' FY22 and further fine tune.  

In Q3' FY22, we will be inviting Agencies to start migration. We recommend to pilot with lower-risk-systems, and then scale to others and agencies.
