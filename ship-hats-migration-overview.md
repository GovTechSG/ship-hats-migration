### Pipeline Definition Format

CI/CD pipeline in SHIP-HATS 2.0 uses [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) for configuration. 

## Why this Change is Essential
Atlassian is sunsetting the support for self-hosted Bitbucket and Bamboo. Therefore, we must replace these tools.  

We are taking the opportunity to move to a SaaS model that enables you to enjoy the benefits of a more progressive CI/CD product with value-added features. Moving from self-hosted COTS to SaaS also enables us to focus our engineering efforts on supporting you with more comprehensive CI/CD templates and other resources to help you get started faster.

## Key Benefits

- **A modernized and updated CI/CD platform:** Stronger integration of CI and CD tools making it easier for agencies to adopt CD using GitLab 
- **Ease of compliance:** Automated DevSecOps capabilities and pipeline-as-a-code to comply with the new DevSecOps Policy easily 
- **Performance Management Dashboard:** Value-Stream Measurement capabilities that allow Agencies to capture key industry metrics, such as lead time to deployment and deployment frequency, to monitor the effectiveness of their DevSecOps practices 
- **Ease of access:** Secure and VPN-less access to the SHIP-HATS 2.0 platform  

?> **Note:** The benefits will be rolled out in phases.
