## Timelines

We have completed evaluating SaaS CI/CD tools based on various factors (such as product offering, migration effort, feature roadmap, and SaaS hosting in Singapore) and procurement process is in progress. We are on track to offer SHIP-HATS 2.0 for pilots in this Q1' FY22. 

Support for SHIP-HATS 1.0 will continue for **at least 1 year** from the roll out of SHIP-HATS 2.0 for all users. 

## Pricing
For all planning purposes, you can refer to Standard Pricing. We will announce the details on the new subscription prices before Q2â€™ FY22. Be assured that we will buffer sufficient time to seek any pricing approvals necessary for the transition.  


## Staggered Migration

We want our users to have minimal disruptions. Therefore, we are taking a careful approach of doing several pilots in Q1' FY22 to shape the migration strategy. We will then test the same on GovTech GDS customers on SHIP-HATS in Q2' FY22 and further fine tune.  

In Q3' FY22, we will be inviting Agencies to start migrations. We recommend to pilot with Lower-Risk-Systems and then scale to others and agencies.
